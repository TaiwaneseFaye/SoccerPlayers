# SoccerPlayers
A program I created in class demonstrating the use of structures. 
Program asks the user for player name, number, and points scored by player. 
Program then uses a structure to produce all the information entered back to 
the user with total points scored by team and the player with the highest score.

# Required Software
Visual Studio 2017

# Instructions
Clone or download the program. Open the project in Visual Studio 2017.
Build the project and then start without debugging to run the project.
